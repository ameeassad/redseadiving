It now lies 24m deep for the deeper part but the mast is only 4m deep and makes a great spot for your safety stop. This former cargo was transporting soft wood and that’s why the Giannis D is also called the «Wood Wreck». The Giannis D is broken into 3 parts: the bow and the stern are in good shape but the middle is in bad condition. Penetration is possible at the stern and you can reach a pocket of trapped air as well as the engine room.

Deep walls surround the island on all sides except the northern point, where the reef slopes very slowly away from the island before dropping to a deep plateau at 40m. This plateau is one of the best places in the Red Sea for diving with sharks. Silvertips and grey reef sharks frequent the area and great hammerheads sometimes rise from the deep for a quick inspection before descending into the deep blue once again.

On the eastern and western walls, it's not about size but about quality. Surrounded by sheer walls covered with black corals, mammoth gorgonian fans with exceptionally dense hard and soft corals covering the spectrum of colours, it's easy to miss all the beauty as your view is obscured by schools of fish so plentiful that it often blocks out the light.
